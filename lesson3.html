         <p>These are the elements of the story;</p>
         <p><b>Characters</b> are living beings that perform every action in the story with the protagonist being the center of attention and the one who leads the story.</p>
         <p>The <b>Setting</b> is also an important element of the story, it tells where or when the story took place. Even the weather is a part of the setting!</p>
         <p>The <b>Plot</b> is what defines the series of events happening in the story, the <b>conflict</b> depicts the disagreement or dispute between opposing forces. The plot is arranged in a chronological order, from the beginning, where <b>foreshadowing</b>, can be mostly found, it gives a hint on what is about to happen later in the story. The middle, this is where the <b>climax</b>, the highest point of the story, mostly happens. Then onto the end, where the story concludes.
